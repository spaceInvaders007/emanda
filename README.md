# Full Stack Engineering Challenge

## Scenario

Youâ€™ve joined a growing software company thatâ€™s building a lightweight task management tool. The application already supports creating and displaying tasks, and the backend supports nested (self-referencing) tasks through a parent-child relationship.

Your job is to extend the applicationâ€™s functionality to enable users to **create subtasks via the UI**, and extend the backend API to retrieve subtasks on demand.

This task is designed to assess your ability to work with a real-world React + NestJS codebase, understand context quickly, and deliver clean, functional improvements.

---

## Tech Stack

This application is built with:

- **Frontend**: React (with TypeScript + Context API)
- **Backend**: NestJS (with TypeORM and SQLite)
- **Database**: SQLite (in-memory)
- **Containerisation**: Docker + Docker Compose
- **Build Tools**: Vite (frontend), Nest CLI (backend)

---

## Whatâ€™s Included

- `frontend/` â€” React app that renders and creates top-level tasks.
- `backend/` â€” NestJS API that supports nested tasks via a self-referencing entity.
- `docker-compose.yml` â€” launches both services together.
- `nginx.conf` â€” proxies API calls from frontend to backend.
- `README.md` â€” this file.

---

## What Works Now

- You can **add top-level tasks** from the UI.
- Tasks (and their nested subtasks) are displayed recursively.
- Tasks are saved via the backend into an in-memory SQLite database.
- API routes:
  - `GET /api/tasks` â€” fetch all tasks with nested subtasks
  - `POST /api/tasks` â€” create a task (optionally with `parentId`)

---

## Your Challenge

To update both frontend and backend to do the following:

### Frontend

- Add UI controls to allow users to create subtasks under any existing task.
- Wire these to the backend using the existing `createTask(title, parentId)` API call.
- Ensure newly created subtasks appear nested under their parent task.

### Backend

- Add a new route to the NestJS backend:
  - `GET /api/tasks/:id/subtasks`
- This should return all tasks where the `parentId` matches the given `id`.
- Implement the corresponding service method in `TasksService`.

You may use TypeORM relations to perform the query. Keep the structure clean and RESTful.

---

## ðŸ§ª Getting Started

### 1. Build the project

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This starts:
- React frontend on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
- NestJS backend on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (proxied via NGINX)

### 2. Add tasks via UI and verify that tasks render correctly.

## Submission

This task is intentionally designed to be focused and time-efficient. We expect that it should take no more than 2 to 4 hours, including time to record a brief walkthrough and reflect on improvements.

When you're done, please submit:

- A link to your Git repo.
- A short description of what you implemented and why (this can be as simple as updating this very README).
- A short video walkthrough describing your solution, key decision points, and the code structure.
- A brief roadmap outlining what you would improve or expand on with more time.

## short description of what you implemented and why

I extended the existing task management application to support hierarchical subtasks with a professional user interface. 

The key additions include:

for Frontend:

- Added UI controls to create subtasks under any existing task

- Created a professional design system with reusable components (Button, Input, Card, Modal)

- Added delete functionality for individual tasks and a reset button to clear all tasks

- Implemented a custom modal dialog to replace browser alerts for task deletion confirmation

- Implemented proper code splitting and component architecture for maintainability

for Backend:

- Added a new REST endpoint GET /api/tasks/:id/subtasks to retrieve subtasks for a specific parent task

- Enhanced the existing service layer to support recursive subtask loading
I
- Implemented proper validation and error handling for the new endpoint

- Added the functionality to delete tasks


## A brief roadmap outlining what you would improve or expand on with more time.

Enhanced User Experience:

- Add drag-and-drop functionality to reorder tasks and subtasks

- Implement task completion status with checkboxes and visual indicators

- Add due dates and priority levels for tasks

- Create task templates for common workflows

- Add search and filtering capabilities

- Implement task categories or tags for better organization

- Add time tracking for tasks

- Implement task archiving instead of permanent deletion

Technical Improvements:

- Add comprehensive unit and integration tests

- Implement real-time collaboration with WebSocket connections

- Add offline support with local storage synchronization

- Create a mobile-responsive design

Data & Analytics:

- Add task completion analytics and reporting

- Implement task progress tracking with visual charts

- Create export functionality (PDF, CSV, JSON)

- Add task history and audit logs

Performance & Scalability:

- Implement pagination for large task lists

- Add database persistence (PostgreSQL/MySQL) instead of in-memory SQLite

- Implement caching strategies for better performance

- Add API rate limiting and authentication

Developer Experience:

- Add comprehensive API documentation

- Implement proper error boundaries and logging

- Add CI/CD pipeline with automated testing

- Create Docker production configurations
